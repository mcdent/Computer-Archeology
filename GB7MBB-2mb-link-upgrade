Notes on 2Mb, 2.4GHz link from Lancaster University to GB7MBB site.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Object:
~~~~~~
To upgrade the existing Lurpac amateur radio data link from 9600 bps to
2Mb/s. The link is currently running near to capacity. Wavelan(tm) wireless
network cards and linux PC's acting as routers are to be used.
Lancaster University is at OS map ref SD486574 atop Bowland Tower @ 150 feet
above ground level. GB7MBB is at OS map ref. SD439637 with the antenna approx.
30 feet above ground level. The line of site path is 5 miles (8km). The beam
heading from Bowland Tower to GB7MBB is 328 degrees.

Miscellaneous.

Task.							Date.
Both PC's brought into workshop for tests.		DONE  2/6/97
It was noticed efficiency of Wavelan cards seemed to
deterioate as card temperature increased. Further tests
may be needed.

Fitted mini fans inside both PC's to aid cooling of	DONE  3/6/97
Wavelan cards.

Antenna at GB7MBB end may need slight re-alignment	DONE 7/6/97
now coax at both ends has been changed for low loss.

New yagis arrived.					    11/8/97

Completed construction of new yagis including weather
proofing etc.						DONE 15/8/97

Costing of equipment.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2 x Wavelan ISA cards @ 500 ea. 1000 pound.
20m of LDF4-50 coax at approx 5 pound/metre. 100 pound.
2 x Tona 25 ele yagis @ 65 pound each. 130 pound

Other parts.
20 foot alluminium scaffold pole. 30 pounds
2 x K stand off wall brackets. 30 pounds
2 x 486 pc's. 600 pounds
4 x connectors for Andrews LDF-450 cable. 80 pounds
Shelving for Bowland Twr. 10 pounds
Sealing tapes and greases. 10 pounds

Estimated total cost of equipment for both ends is 2000 pounds.

Notes:
~~~~~~
It is thought that the Tonna yagi antennas may be operating outside there
recommended operating frequency which would be reducing the effective gain.
One option is to replace the antenna at the Bowland Tower end with a prime
focus 1m diameter dish. A dish has been sourced, enquires have been made
for a suitable feed for 2.4GHz. 5/6/97

I fed the dimensions of the yagis into an antenna anaylsis program and the
operating frequency, the results where very poor, some 6dbi of forward gain
instead of the quoted 18.3dbi from the manafacturer. 10/6/97

I have just discovered that Tonna make a second version of their 13cm yagi
which is tuned almost exactly for the operating frequency of the Wavelan cards!
2 of these new style yagis have been ordered. 17/7/97

The yagis are not expected until early September, Tonna factory closes down
for August! 17/7/97

Good news! The yagis arrived today. I am off work but will be making a special
trip to pick them up to begin construction.
The yagis look almost identical to the others except the elements are slightly
shorter. They also have a one piece boom which is much better that the
jointed boom and they have a weatherproof cap to fit over the front of the
cavity. 11/8.97.
Diverted some routes from Lurpac gateway over 2mb link. 1/9/97

Completed diverting all routes from Lurpac to gb7mbb.ampr.org via
the new 2mb link. 7/9/97

Path loss figures, Bowland Tower to GB7MBB in Morecambe:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Estimated free space path loss including round hill loss (5db)	-123db
Gain of yagi 1							+ 18db
Gain of yagi 2							+ 18db
Output power from wavelan card.					+ 15db
Loss of 10m of Andrews LDF4-50 coaxial feeder @ GB7MBB		- 1.5db
loss of 5m of Andrews LDF4-50 coaxial feeder @ Bowland Twr.	- 0.75db
								---------
Overall path loss	                                        - 74.2db
								---------
Notes:
~~~~~~
The Wavelan specification states a receive sensitivity of -80db this leaves
a margin of almost 6db. Therefore we can assume the link should work with these
figures. If however the efficency of the yagis drops off at our operating
frequency this may bring the overall path loss nearer to that of the receive
sensitivity of the Wavelan cards.
