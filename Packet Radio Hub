Some information I put together back in the early 1990's about becoming a site/operator for
a Packet Radio / AMPRNet hub/node.
***
Important notes for Hub SysOps.

1)	MUST operate 24hrs
2)	Must have a good understanding of the software (Nos etc) they use and also have a good knowledge of IP routing and bit masking.
3)	Should be at low altitude, e.g. valley bottom, and not at a high location. Stations at high locations could possibly act as link stations for hubs.
4)	MUST use only low power (only enough to server its users) on the user freq.
5)	Should be willing to link to another hub station (or linking node) on a frequency other than the user frequency at some time in the future.
6)	Must be willing to issue IP addresses to its users and forward these details on a regular basis to the regional co-ordinator for forwarding to the WW amprnet dns. (ucsd.edu).
7)	Must be keen and enthusiastic to see a better and more structured network in place!
8)	A full and clean driving licence is essential :-).
